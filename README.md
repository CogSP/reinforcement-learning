- [Tabular Solution Methods](notes/tabular_solution_methods/README.md): state and action spaces are small enough to be represented as arrays and tables. We can find exact solution: optimal value function and optimal policy. 

- Approximate Methods: find approximate solutions but can be applied to much larger problem.
